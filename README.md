# SwiftUI example of using OpenWeather Current Weather Data API library


## OWMCall

[**OWMCall**](https://github.com/workingDog/OWMCall) is a small Swift library to connect to the [OpenWeather Current Weather Data API](https://openweathermap.org/api#current) and retrieve the chosen current weather data. Made easy to use with **SwiftUI**.

Provides for current weather data through a single function call.

See **ContentView** for the example use. Note, you need to add your own `OpenWeather key`
in the **ContentView**.

### Requirement

Requires a valid OpenWeather key, see:
